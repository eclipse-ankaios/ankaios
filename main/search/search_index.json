While it can be used for various fields of applications, it is developed from scratch for automotive use cases and provides a slim, yet powerful solution to manage containerized applications. It supports various container runtimes with Podman as the first one, but other container runtimes and even native applications can be supported. Eclipse Ankaios is independent of existing communication frameworks like SOME/IP, DDS, or REST API.</p> <p>Eclipse Ankaios manages multiple nodes and virtual machines with a single unique API in order to start, stop, configure, and update containers and workloads. It provides a central place to manage automotive applications with a setup consisting of one server and multiple agents. Usually one agent per node connects to one or more runtimes that are running the workloads.</p>"},{"location":"#next-steps","title":"Next steps","text":"<ul> <li>For first steps see installation and quickstart.</li> <li>An overview how Ankaios works is given on the architecture page.</li> <li>A tutorial Sending and receiving vehicle signals demonstrates the use of Ankaios with some workloads.</li> <li>The Manage a fleet of vehicles from the cloud tutorial shows how an Ankaios workload can access the Ankaios control interface in order to provide remote management capabilities.</li> <li>The API is described in the reference section.</li> <li>For contributions have a look at the contributing pages.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Eclipse Ankaios follows the UNIX philosophy to have one tool for one job and do that job well. It does not depend on a specific init system like systemd but can be started with any init system. It also does not handle persistency but can use  an existing automotive persistency handling, e.g. provided by AUTOSAR Adaptive.</p> <p>The workloads are provided access to the Eclipse Ankaios API using access control and thus are able to dynamically reconfigure the system. One possible use case is the dynamic startup of an application that is only required in a particular situation such as a parking assistant. When the driver wants to park the car, a control workload can start the parking assistant application. When the parking is finished, the parking assistant workload is stopped again.</p> <p>Eclipse Ankaios also provides a CLI that allows developers to develop and test configurations. In order to gain compatibility with Kubernetes, Eclipse Ankaios accepts pod specifications.</p> <p>An optional fleet connector can use the Eclipse Ankaios API to connect to a cloud-based software update system, which allows an OEM to manage a fleet of vehicles and provide new states to Eclipse Ankaios in order to update single or all applications.</p> <p>In order to support the Automotive SPICE process, Eclipse Ankaios comes with requirements tracing supported by OpenFastTrace.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/","title":"Architecture","text":""},{"location":"architecture/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Two executables are used for each Ankaios deployment: the Ankaios server and the Ankaios agent:</p> <p></p> <p>When started, the Ankaios server loads the configured startup manifest file of the cluster and stores it as a desired state. To reach this desired state, the server instructs the Ankaios agents to start and stop workloads. Each Ankaios cluster runs exactly one instance of the Ankaios server making the server the single source of truth.</p> <p>A running instance of the Ankaios agent is present on every node where Ankaios needs to execute workloads. The Ankaios agent is responsible for starting and stopping workloads, according to the commands it gets from the Ankaios server.</p> <p>The Ankaios server itself does not run workloads directly so in order to start workloads on the node running the server, an Ankaios agent shall be started there too.</p> <p>Ankaios also allows workloads to change the state stored in the Ankaios server via the control interface. Workloads access this interface by sending their requests to the Ankaios agent managing them. Each request is checked by the Ankaios agent and, on successful authorization, forwarded to the Ankaios server. This interface can be used to, e.g.:</p> <ul> <li>Dynamically reconfigure the system to start a parking assistant.</li> <li>Start additional workloads requested by an OEM backend to collect data about the road condition.</li> </ul> <p>In the diagram above one of the workloads on node 1 acts as fleet connector.

It employs a keyword-driven approach, which means that test cases are written using a combination of keywords that represent actions, objects, and verifications. These keywords can be custom-defined by using Python programming language or come from libraries specific to the application under test. One of the standout features of Robot Framework is its human-readable syntax. Test cases are written in plain text composed with defined keywords, making it accessible to non-programmers and allowing stakeholders to understand and contribute to test case creation. Because of the ability to create custom keywords, a pool of domain specific and generic keywords could be defined to form an Ankaios project specific language for writing test cases.This makes it possible to directly use the test specifications written in natural language or the same wording of it to write automated test cases.
