*** Test Cases ***

# [stest->swdd~podman-create-mounts-workload-files~1]
Test Ankaios starts manifest with workload files assigned to workloads
    [Documentation]    Create the assigned workload files on the agent's host file system and mount it into workloads.
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    # Actions
    When Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/manifest_with_workload_files.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "workload_with_mounted_text_file" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_A"
    And the workload "workload_with_mounted_binary_file" shall have the execution state "Succeeded(Ok)" on agent "agent_A"
    And the command "curl -Lf localhost:8087/custom" shall finish with exit code "0"
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios

# [stest->swdd~podman-create-mounts-workload-files~1]
Test Ankaios updates a workload upon update of its workload file content
    [Documentation]    Re-create the new workload file on the host file system and
    ...                mount it in the new updated version of the workload.

Test Ankaios updates a workload upon adding additional workload files
    [Documentation]    Re-create all the workload files including the new one on the host file system,
    ...                mount it in the new updated version of the workload and execute it.
