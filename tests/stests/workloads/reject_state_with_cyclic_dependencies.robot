Test Ankaios reject startup state config with cyclic interworkload dependencies
    [Documentation]    The cycle is workload_A <-> workload_B inside startup state.
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    # Actions
    # The startup config is invalid because it contains a cycle inside the interworkload dependencies config
    When Ankaios server is started with an invalid config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/state_with_dependency_cycle.yaml"
    # Asserts
    Then the Ankaios server shall exit with an error code
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios

Test Ankaios CLI update state with cycle in interworkload dependencies is rejected by Ankaios server
