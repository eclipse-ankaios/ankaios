Test Ankaios Podman create and remove workloads
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/default.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_B"
    And all workloads of agent "agent_B" have an initial execution state
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    And all workloads of agent "agent_A" have an initial execution state
    # Actions
    When user triggers "ank get workloads"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "nginx" shall have the execution state "Running" on agent "agent_A"
    And the workload "hello1" shall have the execution state "Removed" from agent "agent_B"
    And the workload "hello2" shall have the execution state "Succeeded" on agent "agent_B"

    # Actions
    When user triggers "ank delete workload nginx"

    And the workload "hello3" shall have the execution state "Succeeded" on agent "agent_B"
