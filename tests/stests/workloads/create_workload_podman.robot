*** Test Cases ***

# [stest->swdd~agent-supports-podman~2]
# [stest->swdd~podman-create-workload-runs-workload~1]
Test Ankaios Podman create workloads
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/default.yaml"
    # Actions
    When Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_B"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "nginx" shall have the execution state "Running" on agent "agent_A" within "30" seconds
    And the workload "hello1" shall have the execution state "Removed" from agent "agent_B" within "30" seconds
    And the workload "hello2" shall have the execution state "Succeeded" on agent "agent_B" within "30" seconds
    And the workload "hello3" shall have the execution state "Succeeded" on agent "agent_B" within "30" seconds
    And podman shall have a container for workload "nginx" on agent "agent_A"
    And podman shall not have a container for workload "hello1" on agent "agent_B"
    And podman shall have a container for workload "hello2" on agent "agent_B"
    And podman shall have a container for workload "hello3" on agent "agent_B"
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
