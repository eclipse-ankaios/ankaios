# [stest->swdd~config-renderer-supports-rendering-with-keeping-line-indent~1]
Test Ankaios start up with templated Ankaios manifest keeping indentation level of rendered multi-line config
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all pods and volumes in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing pods
    And Podman has deleted all existing volumes
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/manifest_with_multi_line_config.yaml"
    # Actions
    When Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "nginx_with_custom_config" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_A" within "20" seconds
    And the command "curl -fL localhost:8086/custom" shall finish with exit code "0" within "2" seconds
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
