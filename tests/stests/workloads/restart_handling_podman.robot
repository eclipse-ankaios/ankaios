# [stest->swdd~workload-control-loop-restarts-workload-with-enabled-restart-policy~1]
Test Ankaios restarts workloads with restart policy ALWAYS.
    [Documentation]    Restart workloads with restart policy set to ALWAYS and
    ...                ignores workloads with restart policy set to NEVER.
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios
    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    # Actions
    When Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/state_with_restart_policies.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    And podman has assigned a container id for workload "restarted_always" on agent "agent_A"
    And podman has assigned a container id for workload "restarted_never" on agent "agent_A"
    And podman has assigned a container id for workload "default_restarted_never" on agent "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    # Due to polling, the use of execution states to detect a restart results in unstable tests because it is very fast switching.
    Then the container of workload "restarted_always" shall have a different id but same configuration on the podman runtime
    And the workload "restarted_always" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_A"
    And the workload "restarted_never" shall have the execution state "Succeeded(Ok)" on agent "agent_A"
    And the workload "default_restarted_never" shall have the execution state "Succeeded(Ok)" on agent "agent_A"
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
