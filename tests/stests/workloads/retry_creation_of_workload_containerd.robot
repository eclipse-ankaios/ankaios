Test Ankaios containerd retry creation of a workload on creation failure
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the containerd have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given containerd has deleted all existing containers
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/containerd_invalid_image.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload state of workload "invalid_image_workload" shall contain an additional info signaling retries within "5" seconds
