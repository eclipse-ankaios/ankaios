# [stest->swdd~workload-control-loop-restarts-workload-with-enabled-restart-policy~1]
Test Ankaios restarts podman kube workloads with restart policy ALWAYS.
    [Documentation]    Restart workloads with restart policy set to ALWAYS on runtime podman-kube
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios
    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    # Actions
    When Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/state_with_restart_policies.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_B"
    And the workload "kube_restarted_always" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_B" within "10" seconds
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "kube_restarted_always" shall have a different id but same configuration on the runtime
    And the workload "kube_restarted_always" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_B" within "10" seconds
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
