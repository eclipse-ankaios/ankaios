*** Test Cases ***

# [stest->swdd~agent-supports-podman-kube-runtime~1]
# [stest->swdd~podman-kube-create-workload-apply-manifest~1]

Test Ankaios Podman create kube workload
    [Setup]    Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all pods and volume in the podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing pods
    And Podman has deleted all existing volumes
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/kube.yaml"
    # Actions
    When Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # Asserts
    Then the workload "hello-k8s" shall have the execution state "Running(Ok)" on agent "agent_A" within "30" seconds
    And podman shall have a container for workload "hello-pod-hello-container" with custom name "hello-pod-hello-container" on agent "agent_A"
    And volumes for "hello-k8s" shall exist on "agent_A"
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
