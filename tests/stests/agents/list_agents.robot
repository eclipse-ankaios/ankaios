*** Test Cases ***

# [stest->swdd~cli-provides-list-of-agents~1]
Test Ankaios CLI lists connected agents
    [Setup]        Setup Ankaios
    # Preconditions
    # This test assumes that all containers in Podman have been created with this test -> clean it up first
    Given Podman has deleted all existing containers
    And Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/default.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "agent_A"
    # The agent_A is started and connected
    And all workloads of agent "agent_A" have an initial execution state
    # The agent_B is not started and thus not connected
    And the workload "hello1" shall have the execution state "Pending(Initial)" on agent "agent_B"
    And the workload "hello2" shall have the execution state "Pending(Initial)" on agent "agent_B"
    And the workload "hello3" shall have the execution state "Pending(Initial)" on agent "agent_B"
    # Actions
    When user triggers "ank -k get agents"
    # Asserts
    Then the last command shall list the connected agent "agent_A"

    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios
