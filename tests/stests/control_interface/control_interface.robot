# [stest->swdd~agent-control-interface-created-for-eligible-workloads~1]
Test Ankaios workload successful start-up without a Control Interface access
    [Setup]           Run Keywords    Setup Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    Given Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/simple.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "${agent_name}"
    And all workloads of agent "{agent_name}" have an initial execution state
    # Actions
    # Asserts
    Then the mount point has not been generated for ${agent_name}
    [Teardown]    Clean up Ankaios

    # Preconditions
    Given Ankaios server is started with config "${CONFIGS_DIR}/simple_with_control.yaml"
    And Ankaios agent is started with name "${agent_name}"
    And all workloads of agent "{agent_name}" have an initial execution state
    # Actions
    When user triggers "ank -k apply ${CONFIGS_DIR}/simple.yaml"
