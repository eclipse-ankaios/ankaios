# Ankaios Command Line Interface - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the Ankaios Ank. The Ankaios Ank is the Command Line Interface (CLI) of Ankaios.

Ankaios is a workload orchestrator supporting a subset of the Kubernetes configurations and is targeted at the automotive use case.

The CLI is a command line tool, which allows developers to directly interact with the cluster. E.g. it allows to get or set current state, get workloads...

## Context View

The Ankaios Ank is connected to the Server through the same interface as the Agent.

## Constraints, risks and decisions

No Constraints or risks are known at the time of writing this document.

### Design decisions

The following section holds the design decisions taken during the development of the CLI.

#### CLI uses proprietary tracing

`swdd~cli-use-proprietary-tracing~1`

Status: approved

The CLI shall use its own proprietary tracing functions with following features:

| message type     | output       | features                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| error            | `io::stderr` | writes a message to the output and terminates the application with exit code `1`          |
| command response | `io::stdout` | writes a message to the output and terminates the application with exit code `0`          |
| debug            | `io::stdout` | writes a message to the output if the verbose mode is enabled (does not terminate the application) |

Rationale:

The CLI is an application different than Ankaios server or Ankaios agent.
The CLI interacts directly with the user and the user expects a response to the command (if available).
Therefore the information shall not be written to the log, but it shall be provided to the user.

Existing crates either do not behave as it is required or they are too complex for such task.

Needs:

* impl

Considered alternatives:

* keep on using the environment logger
* use another crate which provides tracing functions

## Structural view

Following diagram shows the structural view of the Ankaios Ank.

![Unit overview](drawio/unit_overview.drawio.svg)

### CLI (parser)

The CLI parses the commands entered by the user.
This also includes error handling when the user enters unsupported command or forgets to set a mandatory parameter.

### CliCommands

The CliCommands implements the commands.
It uses ExecutionCommand Channel and StateChangeCommand Channel to interact with the server.

### External Libraries

#### Communication Middleware

The Communication Middleware is responsible for the connection between the Ankaios Server and the Ankaios Agent or the Ankaios CLI.

#### ExecutionCommand Channel, StateChangeCommand Channel

The channels are defined in the `common` library.

## Behavioral view

This chapter defines the runtime behavior of the Ankaios Ank in details. The following chapters show essential parts of the behavior and describe the requirements towards the Ankaios Ank.

### Startup

The Ankaios Ank is a standalone application which starts when the user enters a command and terminates as soon as the command exits.
Here is an overview how each command looks like:

![Command Overview](plantuml/seq_cmd_overview.svg)

The startup section is detailed in the next diagram.
Implementation of each command is detailed in the next sub-chapters.

![Startup](plantuml/seq_cmd_startup.svg)

#### Ankaios CLI communicates only with the Ankaios Server
`swdd~server-handle-cli-communication~1`

Status: approved

The Ankaios CLI shall only directly communicate with the Ankaios Server.

Tags:
- CliStartup

Needs:

#### All communication between Server and Ankaios CLI goes through Communication Middleware
`swdd~cli-communication-over-middleware~1`

Status: approved

All communication between Server and Ankaios CLI goes through a Communication Middleware plugin configured at compile time for the Ankaios Server and Ankaios CLI.

#### CLI supports environment variables
`swdd~cli-shall-support-environment-variables~1`

Status: approved
