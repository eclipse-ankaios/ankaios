# Ankaios Server - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the Ankaios Server.

Ankaios is a Workload orchestrator supporting a subset of the Kubernetes configurations and is targeted at the automotive use case.

The Ankaios Server is the main component of the Ankaios orchestrator and is responsible for the configuration of the cluster, managing the communication with the Ankaios Agents.

## Context View

An Ankaios Server is connected to multiple Agents that are deployed on the same or on different nodes. The Server communicates with the Agents to:

* send the Agents lists of Workloads scheduled for them
* forward Workload State between Agents
* receive execution requests from Workloads running on an Agent

The following diagram shows a high level view of an Ankaios Server in its context:

## Constraints, risks and decisions

### Design decisions

## Structural view

The following diagram shows the structural view of the Ankaios Server:

![Overview](drawio/comp_overview.drawio.svg)

### AnkaiosServer

The AnkaiosServer is the main component of the Ankaios Server. It is responsible for the business logic of the Server which, amongst others, includes storing the current state, handling StateChangeRequests from the StateChangeCommandChannel and distributing ExecutionRequests and ExecutionStateUpdates through the ExecutionCommandChannel via the Communication Middleware to the Agents.

For simplicity, the initial setup of the Ankaios Server done in the main.rs is also counted as part of this unit.

### StartupStateLoader

The StartupStateLoader loads the initial startup state, parses it and pushes it into the AnkaiosServer. The StartupStateLoader is also responsible for persisting the startup state.

### Communication Middleware

The Communication Middleware is responsible for:

* establishing the connections to multiple Ankaios Agents.
* forwarding the ExecutionRequests and ExecutionStateUpdates from AnkaiosServer to the proper Ankaios Agents through the xecutionCommandChannel.
* forwarding the StateChangeRequests from connected Agents to the AnkaiosServer.

### WorkloadStateDB

The WorkloadStateDB is a data structure for storing the Workload States of each nodes.

## Behavioral view

### Startup sequence

The following diagram shows the startup sequence of the Ankaios Server:

![Startup](plantuml/seq_startup.svg)

#### Server holds Current State in memory
`swdd~server-state-in-memory~1`

Status: approved

The Ankaios Server shall hold the Current State in memory.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl

#### Server loads Startup State from a file
`swdd~server-loads-startup-state-file~2`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Server starts up and a startup configuration is provided,
Ankaios shall load the Startup State specified in the startup configuration as Current State.

Note: This requirement describes only current intermediate state. The final implementation may work differently.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl

### Server starts without startup config
`swdd~server-starts-without-startup-config~1`

When the Ankaios server is started without a startup config, the server shall start with an empty current state.

Rationale:
The Ankaios Server can also start in the "empty startup state" and get the configuration subsequently from the CLI.

Needs:
- impl
- stest

#### StartupStateLoader parses yaml with Startup State
`swdd~stored-workload-spec-parses-yaml~1`

#### StartupStateLoader rejects invalid config
`swdd~stored-workload-spec-checks-unique-name~1`

Status: approved

When the StartupStateLoader parses the yaml file with Startup State, it shall reject the file which is not conform to the verification schema.

Rationale: The startup configuration may contain copy-paste errors etc. Broken configuration shall be rejected by the parser.
