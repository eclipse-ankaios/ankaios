# Ankaios Server - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the Ankaios Server.

Ankaios is a Workload orchestrator supporting a subset of the Kubernetes configurations and is targeted at the automotive use case.

The Ankaios Server is the main component of the Ankaios orchestrator and is responsible for the configuration of the cluster, managing the communication with the Ankaios Agents.

## Context View

An Ankaios server is connected to multiple agents that are deployed on the same or on different nodes. The server communicates with the agents to:

* send the agents lists of workloads scheduled for them
* forward workload state between agents
* receive ToServer messages from workloads running on an agent

The following diagram shows a high level view of an Ankaios Server in its context:

## Constraints, risks and decisions

### Design decisions

## Structural view

The following diagram shows the structural view of the Ankaios Server:

![Overview](drawio/comp_overview.drawio.svg)

### AnkaiosServer

The AnkaiosServer is the main component of the Ankaios Server. It is responsible for the business logic of the Server which, amongst others, includes storing the current state, handling ToServer messages from the ToServerChannel and distributing FromServer messages through the FromServerChannel via the Communication Middleware to the Agents.

For simplicity, the initial setup of the Ankaios Server done in the main.rs is also counted as part of this unit.

### StartupStateLoader

The StartupStateLoader loads the initial startup state, parses it and pushes it into the AnkaiosServer. The StartupStateLoader is also responsible for persisting the startup state.

### Communication Middleware

The Communication Middleware is responsible for:

* establishing the connections to multiple Ankaios Agents.
* forwarding the FromServer messages from AnkaiosServer to the proper Ankaios Agents through the FromServerChannel.
* forwarding the ToServer messages from connected Agents to the AnkaiosServer.

### WorkloadStateDB

The WorkloadStateDB is a data structure for storing the Workload States of each nodes.

### ServerState

The ServerState is a data structure for maintaining the state of the Ankaios server. It prevents invariants when updating the state, by doing checks on the new state
before applying it or when a view on the state is requested.

## Behavioral view

### Startup sequence

The following diagram shows the startup sequence of the Ankaios Server:

![Startup](plantuml/seq_startup.svg)

#### Server holds Current State in memory
`swdd~server-state-in-memory~1`

Status: approved

The Ankaios Server shall hold the Current State in memory.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl

#### Server loads Startup State from a file
`swdd~server-loads-startup-state-file~2`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Server starts up and a startup configuration is provided,
Ankaios shall load the Startup State specified in the startup configuration as Current State.

Note: This requirement describes only current intermediate state. The final implementation may work differently.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl

#### Server starts without startup config
`swdd~server-starts-without-startup-config~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios server is started without a startup config, the server shall start with an empty current state.

Rationale:
The Ankaios Server can also start in the "empty startup state" and get the configuration subsequently from the CLI.

#### StartupStateLoader parses yaml with Startup State
`swdd~stored-workload-spec-parses-yaml~1`

#### StartupStateLoader rejects invalid config
`swdd~stored-workload-spec-checks-unique-name~1`

Status: approved

When the StartupStateLoader parses the yaml file with Startup State, it shall reject the file which is not conform to the verification schema.

Rationale: The startup configuration may contain copy-paste errors etc. Broken configuration shall be rejected by the parser.

Tags:

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Ankaios server fails to start on invalid startup state config
`swdd~server-fails-on-invalid-startup-state~1`

Status: approved

When the Startup State is invalid, the server shall not start.

Comment: If the Startup State is invalid no workloads can be deployed.

Rationale: Invalid States shall be avoided to preserve internal invariants.

- utest

##### UpdateCurrentState interface with update_mask
`swdd~update-current-state-with-update-mask~1`

Status: approved

Tags:
- ControlInterface

Needs:
- impl
- utest

Comment: If one field from the update_mask is not present in the CurrentState, this field is created. This can include any amount of parent fields.

If one field from the update_mask is not present in the newState, this field is deleted from the CurrentState.

### Update Current State

The behavioral diagram of the updating current state is shown in the chapter "UpdateState interface".

#### Server detects new workload
`swdd~server-detects-new-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Server gets the `ToServer` message `UpdateState` and detects a change of the state where a workload is present only in the New State,
the Ankaios Server shall send a `FromServer` message to the corresponding Ankaios Agent to add the workload.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl
- utest
- itest

#### Server detects deleted workload
`swdd~server-detects-deleted-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Server gets the `ToServer` message `UpdateState` and detects a change of the state where a workload is present only in the Current State,
the Ankaios Server shall send a `FromServer` message to the corresponding Ankaios Agent to delete the workload.

Tags:
- AnkaiosServer

Needs:
- impl
- utest
- itest

#### Server detects changed workload
`swdd~server-detects-changed-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Server gets the `ToServer` message `UpdateState` and detects a change of the state where a workload is present in both states
and at least one field of the workload is different,
the Ankaios Server shall send a `FromServer` message to the corresponding Ankaios Agents to delete and add the workload.

#### ServerState rejects state with cycle
`swdd~server-state-rejects-state-with-cyclic-dependencies~1`

Status: approved

When the ServerState is requested to update its State and the new State has a cycle in the workload dependencies, the server shall reject the new State as invalid.

Rationale: A cyclic dependency between workloads will prevent the affected workloads from starting rendering the state invalid.

Comment: The inter workload dependencies config within a state is only valid if the dependencies form an directed acyclic graph.

Tags:
- ServerState

Needs:
- impl
- utest
- stest

#### Cycle detection stops on the first detected cycle
`swdd~cycle-detection-stops-on-the-first-cycle~1`

Status: approved

When the ServerState searches for cycles within the dependency graph of the State,
the ServerState shall stop at the first detected cycle.

Rationale: Searching all cycles in a graph might have performance impacts and is not in the scope of the project.

Comment: With only one cycle, the log message remains clearer.

Tags:
- ServerState

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Cycle detection ignores non existing workload dependencies
`swdd~cycle-detection-ignores-non-existing-workloads~1`

Status: approved

When the ServerState searches for cycles within the dependency graph of the State
and it encounters an edge in the dependency graph that refers to a workload that does not occur in the workload nodes,
the ServerState shall ignore this edge.

Rationale: A user might want to put a workload into the State that has a dependency to a workload which config is not prepared and published into the State yet.

Comment: Continuation of the cycle search in that case does not break the cycle detection algorithm because a dependency to a workload that is not part of the State cannot introduce a cycle.

- ServerState

Needs:
- impl
- utest
- stest

#### Server continues when receiving an invalid state
`swdd~server-continues-on-invalid-updated-state~1`

Status: approved

When the ServerState rejects an updated state, the server shall continue to listen for incoming requests.

Comment: The continuation allows the user to retry the update of the state.

Rationale: The continuation allows better use-ability.
