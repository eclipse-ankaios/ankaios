# Ankaios Agent - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the Ankaios Agent. 

Ankaios is a workload orchestrator supporting a subset of the Kubernetes configurations and is targeted at the automotive use case.

The Ankaios Agent is one of the components of the Ankaios orchestrator and is responsible for running Workloads on the Agent node and forwarding execution requests to the Server.

## Context View

An Ankaios Agent is connected to one single instance of an Ankaios Server. The Agent communicates with the Server to:
* get list of Workloads scheduled for that particular Agent
* get execution statuses of Workloads on other Agents
* forward execution requests from authorized Workloads to the Server

The following diagram shows a high level view of an Ankaios Agent in its context:

![Context View](drawio/context_view.drawio.svg)

Please note that the Ankaios Agent could also run on the same node as the Server.

## Constraints, risks and decisions

### Design decisions

## Structural view

The following diagram shows the structural view of the Ankaios Agent:

![Overview](drawio/comp_overview.drawio.svg)

### AgentManager

The AgentManager is the main component in the Ankaios Agent and is responsible, amongst others, for pushing Workloads to the runtime adapters and serving the Ankaios Control Interface by authorizing requests from the workloads to the Ankaios Server.

For simplicity, the initial setup of the Ankaios Agent done in the main.rs is also counted as part of this unit.

### RuntimeAdapter

The RuntimeAdapter provides common functionality used by all runtime adapters.

### PodmanAdapter

The PodmanAdapter is a RuntimeAdapter for Podman. It is responsible for dealing with the podman Workloads (start, stop).

### PodmanWorkload

The PodmanWorkload uses Podman REST API to process events from the PodmanAdapter. 
The PodmanWorkload also checks periodically status of the podman workload and reports changes of the status. 

### ParameterStorage

Stores information which the Agent gets from the Server. Currently the storage stores the workload status and mapping from workload name to runtime name.

### External Libraries

#### Communication Middleware

The Middleware is responsible for the connection to the Ankaios Server.

#### ExecutionCommand Channel, StateChangeCommand Channel

The channels are defined in the `common` library.
They are used to connect modules in the Ankaios Agent, more precisely they connect task in which modules run.


## Behavioral view

This chapter defines the runtime behavior of the Ankaios Agent in details. The following chapters show essential parts of the behavior and describe the requirements towards the Ankaios Agent.
### Startup sequence

Status: approved

For each found existing Workload that is request to be started and for which a change in the configuration was detected, the Runtime Adapter shall replace the Workload by creating a new specific Workload and creating the Workload Facade using the replace method.

If the the Runtime Adapter finds an existing Workload that shall now run with a different config according, the Runtime Adapter shall replace the existing Workload with a new one.

Comment:
The Runtime Adapter can check if the specified workload is already running, but was updated by comparing the new workload execution instance name with that of the running instance.

Tags:
- PodmanAdapter

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload

The UpdateWorkload message contains two lists of workloads - deleted Workloads specified by name and added Workloads including their desired configuration. The Ankaios Agent goes through the deleted Workloads first in order to free resources before starting to allocate new ones.

The following two diagrams show how deleted and added Workloads are handled by the Agent Manager. The first diagram shows how the deleted Workloads are handled:

![Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload - deleted Workloads](plantuml/seq_update_workload_subsequent_deleted.svg)

After the deleted Workloads are handled, the Ankaios Agent goes through the list of added Workloads

![Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload - added Workloads](plantuml/seq_update_workload_subsequent_added.svg)

###### Agent Manager handles deleted workloads before added Workloads
`swdd~agent-handle-deleted-before-added-workloads~1`

Status: approved

The Agent Manager shall first handle the list of deleted Workloads before handling the list of added Workloads.

Comment:
Updated Workloads can be handled before everything is deleted as in the normal case the resource usage will remain the same.

Rationale:
Deleting Workloads first ensures that the machine which executes the workloads has enough resources to start the new ones.

##### Updating a Workload

This is a special situation in which the Ankaios Agent receives a delete and an add command for a workload with the same name.

The following diagram shows the steps taken by the Workload Facade to fulfill the update action:

![Updating a Workload](plantuml/seq_workload_update.svg)

###### Workload Facade update workload
`swdd~agent-facade-update-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Workload Facade gets a requests to update a workload, the Workload Facade shall stop the existing Workload and create a new Workload on its place including starting monitoring it and waiting for stop or update commands.

Comment:
The difference to replace a workload is that when calling an update we don't know if the Workload is started already. For replace we have found the workload, so we are sure that it is running. Handling the update over the command channel of the Workload Facade ensures that we don't start a Workload after it is stopped.

#### Agent ensures the Control Interface output pipes are read
`swdd~agent-ensures-control-interface-output-pipe-read~1`

Status: approved

The Ankaios Agent shall ensure, that Control Interface output pipes are opened and messages are read.

Comment: If the Ankaios Agent does not open and read the Control Interface output pipes, a Workload could block, trying to write the output pipe.

#### Agent handles Control Interface input pipe not being read
`swdd~agent-handles-control-interface-input-pipe-not-read~1`

Status: approved

If a Workload does not read data send to it on the Control Interface input pipe, the Ankaios Agent shall handle this situation gracefully.
Hence the Ankaios Agent:

- does not block
- does not use a infinite amount of memory to store message which could not be sent
- overwhelm the Workload with messages once the Workload starts reading the Control Interface input pipe
