# Ankaios Agent - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the Ankaios Agent.

Ankaios is a workload orchestrator supporting a subset of the Kubernetes configurations and is targeted at the automotive use case.

The Ankaios Agent is one of the components of the Ankaios orchestrator and is responsible for running Workloads on the Agent node and forwarding execution requests to the Server.

## Context View

An Ankaios Agent is connected to one single instance of an Ankaios Server. The Agent communicates with the Server to:
* get list of Workloads scheduled for that particular Agent
* get execution statuses of Workloads on other Agents
* forward execution requests from authorized Workloads to the Server

The following diagram shows a high level view of an Ankaios Agent in its context:

![Context View](drawio/context_view.drawio.svg)

Please note that the Ankaios Agent could also run on the same node as the Server.

## Constraints, risks and decisions

### Design decisions

## Structural view

The following diagram shows the structural view of the Ankaios Agent:

![Overview](drawio/unit_overview.drawio.svg)

### AgentManager

The AgentManager is the entry component in the Ankaios agent and is responsible, amongst others, for receiving commands from the server and forwarding them to the RuntimeManager and for authorizing requests from the workloads to the Ankaios Server.

The initial setup of the Ankaios agent is done in the main.rs is also counted as part of this unit.

### RuntimeManager

The RuntimeManager holds a list of RuntimeFacades (more precisely a list of runtime connectors wrapped into a RuntimeFacade) and a list of running workloads. It is also responsible for the handling the update workload calls including the workload reuse and the logic of translating the added and deleted workload lists into commands to a RuntimeFacade or a WorkloadObject.

### RuntimeFacade

The RuntimeFacade wraps some common actions shared between all runtime connectors, s.t. they don't need to be implemented multiple times. The RuntimeFacade is responsible for creating, resuming and replacing a WorkloadObject including the start of the workload control task. Furthermore, The RuntimeFacade is responsible for providing functionality for deleting workloads that do not have an internal WorkloadObject (found unneeded workloads started in a previous execution of the Ankaios agent).

### WorkloadObject

A WorkloadObject represents a workload inside the Ankaios agent. It holds the control interface and the sender for the communication channel with the workload control task. The WorkloadObject is also responsible for managing the workload control task.

### ParameterStorage

Stores information which the Agent gets from the Server. Currently the storage stores the workload state of workloads for each agent.

### ControlInterface

The ControlInterface is responsible for setting up the communication interface between a workload and the Ankaios agent. It translates between the provided to the workload pipes and the internal Ankaios communication channels.

### RuntimeConnectorInterfaces

This is not really a component but a collection of traits that define the "requirements" towards specific runtime connectors s.t. they can be used by Ankaios. The following three traits specify the interface of the connectors where for one of them (state checker) a reusable default implementation is provided:
* runtime state getter trait - specifies that the workload state can be obtained using a workload id
* state checker trait - specifies that each workload state checker can be stopped
* runtime connector trait - specifies the methods that Ankaios requires in order to use a runtime (see below for more details)

### PodmanRuntime connector

The PodmanRuntime connector implements the runtime connector trait for Podman. It serves as glue between Ankaios and the Podman container engine for running Podman containers.

The PodmanRuntime also implements the runtime state getter trait for Podman to enable getting workload states.

### PodmanKubeRuntime connector

The PodmanKubeRuntime connector implements the runtime connector trait for 'podman play kube'. It serves as glue between Ankaios and the Podman container engine for running Kubernetes manifest files via the Podman container engine. It is implemented as a separate engine as the functionality is very specific.

### GenericPollingStateChecker

The `GenericPollingStateChecker` is a general purpose `StateChecker` (and implements the state checker trait) that can be used by a runtime connector to make polling requests for workload state as predefined intervals.

### External Libraries

#### Communication Middleware

The Middleware is responsible for the connection to the Ankaios Server.

#### ExecutionCommand Channel, StateChangeCommand Channel

The channels are defined in the `common` library.
They are used to connect modules in the Ankaios Agent, more precisely they connect task in which modules run.

## Behavioral view

This chapter defines the runtime behavior of the Ankaios Agent in details. The following chapters show essential parts of the behavior and describe the requirements towards the Ankaios Agent.
### Startup sequence

The following diagram shows the startup sequence of the Ankaios Agent:

![Startup](plantuml/seq_startup.svg)

#### Agent communicates only with the Server
`swdd~agent-shall-use-interfaces-to-server~1`

Status: approved

The Ankaios Agent shall use the given interfaces and channels to communicate with the Server.

### Handling UpdateWorkload commands from the Ankaios Server

The following diagram show the general steps the Ankaios Agent takes when receiving an UpdateWorkload command:

![Handling UpdateWorkload](plantuml/seq_update_workload.svg)

#### Agent Manager creates Control Interface Instance for each workload
`swdd~agent-create-control-interface-pipes-per-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Agent Manager gets an `UpdateWorkload` message, for each added Workload with a runtime that is known, the Agent Manager shall create a Control Interface Instance for this Workload.

Tags:
- AgentManager
- ControlInterface

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Control Interface creates FIFO files for each workload
`swdd~agent-control-interface-creates-two-pipes-per-workload~1`

Status: approved

Each new ControlInterface instance shall create two FIFO files :

- a FIFO file for the workload to send requests to the Control Interface (called output pipe in the following)
- a FIFO file for the workload to request responses to the Control Interface (called input pipe in the following)

Tags:
- ControlInterface

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Control Interface pipes at predefined path
`swdd~agent-control-interface-pipes-path-naming~1`

Status: approved

The Control Interface Instance shall create the Control Interface pipes at the following path:

    `<Agent run folder>/<Workload execution instance name>/`

Rationale:
The Ankaios Agent needs a unique, reproducible name to be able to make the mapping between a workload execution instance and a control interface pipes instance.

Tags:
- ControlInterface

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Agent skips unknown runtime
`swdd~agent-skips-unknown-runtime~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Agent gets an add Workload command with the `UpdateWorklaod` message and the runtime of the Workload is unknown, the RuntimeManager shall skip this Workload.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### RuntimeManager stores Workload in the list of running workloads
`swdd~agent-stores-running-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the RuntimeManager creates new workload objects via the RuntimeFacade, the RuntimeManager shall store the Workload in a list of running workloads.

Comment:
Please note that the object creation is targeted here and thus also resume or replace of running workloads is in scope.

Rationale:
The workload object is later used to update or delete the workload. The object also stores the ControlInterface for the workload and manages it during the lifetime of the workload.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Handling the initial UpdateWorkload after Agent start

The following diagram and the subsequent requirements show the steps the Ankaios Agent takes when receiving the first UpdateWorkload command sent by Server. The first UpdateWorkload contains the complete initial list of workloads the Agent shall manage.

![Handling initial UpdateWorkload](plantuml/seq_update_workload_initial.svg)

##### RuntimeManager initial list of workloads handles existing workloads
`swdd~agent-initial-list-existing-workloads~1`

Status: approved

After receiving the complete list of added workloads from the Ankaios Sever at the initial connection establishment, the RuntimeManager shall handle existing workloads.

Comment:
In case the Agent was already running, the RuntimeManager can take care of Workloads that were started in an earlier execution. Some of these workloads can be reused, some have to be updated and some stopped.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeManager handles existing workloads by building list
`swdd~agent-existing-workloads-finds-list~1`

Status: approved

When handling existing workloads, the RuntimeManager shall call each RuntimeFacade to request a list of existing workloads started during the same machine runtime window by a previous execution of an Ankaios Agent with the same name as the currently running Agent.

Comment:
A 'machine runtime window' is the time between the start and shutdown of the machine. Finding existing workloads needs to be done before stating new workloads in order to avoid conflicts. If this call fails, the agent currently ignores the failure assumes that no workloads are running. It must be confirmed that this behavior is correct.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeFacade forwards list reusable workloads call
`swdd~agent-facade-forwards-list-reusable-workloads-call~1`

Status: approved

When receiving a call to list all reusable workloads, the RuntimeFacade shall forward the call to the wrapped runtime and return the list to the caller.

Comment:
No decoupling is done here and we wait for the list to be built in order to prevent race conditions with calls from the server.

Tags:
- RuntimeFacade

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeManager handles existing workloads starts new only if not found
`swdd~agent-existing-workloads-starts-new-if-not-found~1`

Status: approved

When handling existing workloads, the RuntimeManager shall only request the corresponding RuntimeFacade to start workloads that are not found on the system.

Comment:
The RuntimeManager can check if the specified workload is already running by comparing the new workload execution instance name with that of the running instance. Details about starting a workload can be found further on.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeFacade creates workload
`swdd~agent-create-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the RuntimeFacade gets a requests to create a workload, the RuntimeFacade shall:
* request the wrapped runtime to create the workload (incl. starting the state checker monitoring it)
* start the workload task waiting for stop or update commands for that workload
* return a new workload object allowing the communication with the task handling the stop or update commands

Comment:
The state checker doesn't need to be started as an additional step here as the runtime starts it when creating the workload.

Rationale:
The task handling stop and update commands is needed to ensure maintaining the order of the commands for a workload while not blocking Ankaios to wait until one command is complete.

Tags:
- RuntimeFacade

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeManager handles existing workloads resumes existing workloads
`swdd~agent-existing-workloads-resume-existing~1`

Status: approved

When handling existing workloads, for each found existing workload which is requested to be started and has unchanged configuration, the RuntimeManager shall request the corresponding RuntimeFacade to resume the workload using a new control interface instance.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeFacade resumes workload
`swdd~agent-resume-workload~1`

Status: approved

When requested, the RuntimeFacade resumes a workload by:
* request the wrapped runtime to start the state checker for that workload
* start the workload task waiting for stop or update commands for that workload
* return a new workload object allowing the communication with the task handling the stop or update commands

Comment:
If a workload is running, there is no need to create it again via the specific runtime. The state checker must be started as an additional step here as the runtime does not create a new workload.

Rationale:
The task handling stop and update commands is needed to ensure maintaining the order of the commands for a workload while not blocking Ankaios to wait until one command is complete.

Tags:
- RuntimeFacade

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeManager handles existing workloads replace updated Workloads
`swdd~agent-existing-workloads-replace-updated~1`

Status: approved

When handling existing workloads, for each found existing workload which is requested to be started and for which a change in the configuration was detected, the RuntimeManager shall request the RuntimeFacade to replace the workload.

Comment:
The RuntimeManager can check if the specified workload is already running, but was updated by comparing the new workload execution instance name with that of the running instance.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager
-
Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeFacade replace Workload
`swdd~agent-replace-workload~1`

Status: approved

When requested, the RuntimeFacade replaces a workload by:
* request the wrapped runtime to delete the old workload
* request the wrapped runtime to create a workload with the new config(incl. starting the state checker monitoring it)
* start the workload task waiting for stop or update commands for that workload
* return a new workload object allowing the communication with the task handling the stop or update commands

Comment:
No need to specifically ask for starting the state checker at that point as runtimes are expected to always create a state checker when creating a workload.

Rationale:
The task handling stop and update commands is needed to ensure maintaining the order of the commands for a workload while not blocking Ankaios to wait until one command is complete.

Tags:
- RuntimeFacade

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeManager handles existing workloads deletes unneeded workloads
`swdd~agent-existing-workloads-delete-unneeded~1`

Status: approved

When handling existing workloads, for each found existing workload that is not in the provided list of initial workloads, the RuntimeManager shall request the RuntimeFacade to delete the workload.

If the the RuntimeManager finds an existing Workload that is not in the provided list of initial workloads, the Ankaios Agent shall stop the existing Workload.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### RuntimeFacade delete old workload
`swdd~agent-delete-old-workload~1`

Status: approved

When requested, the RuntimeFacade deletes a workload by:
* deleting the workload via the runtime

Comment:
This delete is done by the specific runtime for a workload Id. No internal workload object is involved in this action.

Tags:
- RuntimeFacade

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload

The UpdateWorkload message contains two lists of workloads - deleted Workloads specified by name and added Workloads including their desired configuration. The Ankaios Agent goes through the deleted Workloads first in order to free resources before starting to allocate new ones.

The following two diagrams show how deleted and added Workloads are handled by the Agent Manager. The first diagram shows how the deleted Workloads are handled:

![Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload - deleted Workloads](plantuml/seq_update_workload_subsequent_deleted.svg)

After the deleted Workloads are handled, the Ankaios Agent goes through the list of added Workloads

![Handling subsequent UpdateWorkload - added Workloads](plantuml/seq_update_workload_subsequent_added.svg)

##### Agent handles deleted workloads before added Workloads
`swdd~agent-handle-deleted-before-added-workloads~1`

Status: approved

The RuntimeManager shall first handle the list of deleted Workloads before handling the list of added Workloads.

Comment:
Updated Workloads can be handled before everything is deleted as in the normal case the resource usage will remain the same.

Rationale:
Deleting Workloads first ensures that the machine which executes the workloads has enough resources to start the new ones.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Agent updates deleted and added workloads
`swdd~agent-updates-deleted-and-added-workloads~1`

Status: approved

The RuntimeManager shall request an update of a workload if the workload is in both the list of deleted and added workloads.

Rationale:
This is needed to ensure the order of the commands.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload handles update command
`swdd~agent-workload-obj-update-command~1`

Status: approved

When the WorkloadObject receives a trigger to update the workload, it:
* stops the old control interface
* stores the new control interface
* sends a command on the command channel to the workload task to update the workload

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task executes update command
`swdd~agent-workload-task-executes-update~1`

Status: approved

When the control task started during the creation of the workload object receives an update command, the workload task shall:
* delete the old workload via the corresponding runtime connector
* stop the state checker for the workload
* create a new workload via the corresponding runtime connector (which creates and starts a state checker)
* store the new Id and reference to the state checker inside the workload control task

Comment:
For details on the runtime connector specific actions, e.g., delete, see the specific runtime connector workflows.

Rationale:
The workload task allows to asynchronously carry out time consuming actions and still maintain the order of the actions as they are queued on a command channel.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task update broken allowed
`swdd~agent-workload-task-update-broken-allowed~1`

Status: approved

When the workload control task has no old workload to delete during the update of a workload, the control task shall continue with the update.

Comment:
The assumption here is that the old workload is not running anymore.

Rationale:
This allows to bring the system into a working state.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task update delete failed allows retry
`swdd~agent-workload-task-update-delete-failed-allows-retry~1`

Status: approved

When the workload control task encounters a failure while deleting the old workload during the update of a workload, the control task shall continue allowing a subsequent update or delete attempt.

Rationale:
This allows to try the update again instead of going in an undefined state.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task update create failed allows retry
`swdd~agent-workload-task-update-create-failed-allows-retry~1`

Status: approved

When the workload control task encounters a failure while creating a new workload during the update of a workload, the control task shall continue allowing a subsequent update or delete attempt.

Rationale:
This allows to try the update again instead of going in an undefined state.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Agent adds on update missing workload
`swdd~agent-add-on-update-missing-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Agent gets an `UpdateWorkload` message that indicates an update of a workload and the workload cannot be found, the RuntimeManager shall trigger adding of the workload.

Comment:
This situation cannot actually occur, but if a workload is requested to be added it shall also be added instead of just tracing an error/warning.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Agent deletes workload on command from server
`swdd~agent-deletes-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios agent receives an `UpdateWorkload` message with a workload for deletion that is not also listed as added workload, the agent shall trigger a deletion of the workload.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload handles delete command
`swdd~agent-workload-obj-delete-command~1`

Status: approved

When the WorkloadObject receives a trigger to delete the workload, it:
* stops the control interface
* sends a command on the command channel to the workload task to delete the workload

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task executes delete command
`swdd~agent-workload-tasks-executes-delete~1`

Status: approved

When the control task started during the creation of the workload object receives a delete command, the workload task shall:
* delete the old workload via the corresponding runtime connector
* stop the state checker for the workload
* send a removed workload state for that workload
* stop the workload control task

Comment:
For details on the runtime connector specific actions, e.g., delete, see the specific runtime connector workflows.

Rationale:
The workload task allows to asynchronously carry out time consuming actions and still maintain the order of the actions as they are queued on a command channel.
As the state checker for the workload is stopped, we cannot be sure that the removed workload state is correctly sent to the server before the state checker is stopped.
For that reason the removed state is explicitly sent, even if it could be sent twice this way.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Workload task delete broken allowed
`swdd~agent-workload-task-delete-broken-allowed~1`

Status: approved

When the workload control task has no old workload to delete during the deletion of a workload, the control task shall exit.

Comment:
The assumption here is that the old workload is not running anymore and the job is done.

Rationale:
This allows to bring the system into a working state.

Tags:
- WorkloadObject

Needs:
- impl

##### Workload task delete failed allows retry
`swdd~agent-workload-task-delete-failed-allows-retry~1`

Status: approved

When the workload control task encounters a failure while deleting the workload, the control task shall continue allowing a subsequent update or delete attempt.

##### Agent updates on add known workload
`swdd~agent-update-on-add-known-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios Agent gets an `UpdateWorkload` message with an added workload that was already started by the RuntimeManager, the RuntimeManager shall trigger the update of the workload.

Comment:
This situation can happen if the Ankaios Server gets restarted. It is not yet confirmed if this handling is correct and it is subject to change.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

##### Agent creates workload
`swdd~agent-added-creates-workload~1`

Status: approved

When the Ankaios agent gets an `UpdateWorkload` message with an added workload that was not started already and the runtime is known, the RuntimeManager shall request the corresponding RuntimeFacade to create the workload.

Tags:
- RuntimeManager

Needs:
- impl
- utest

#### Runtime connector workflows

Ankaios supports multiple runtimes by providing a runtime connector trait specifying the functions that shall be implemented by the runtime.

##### Functions required by the runtime connector trait
`swdd~functions-required-by-runtime-connector~1`

Status: approved

The runtime connector trait shall require the implementation of the following functions:

* get unique runtime connector name
* get list of existing workloads
* create workload
* get workload id for given workload name
* start the state checker
* delete workload

Comment:
The function "create workload" shall also start the workload and start the state checker.
Next subchapters describe features of these functions specific for each runtime connector.

Rationale:
The function to start the state checker shall be public (i.e. not only embedded into the "create workload")
to distinguish between use cases to create new workload object and to resume existing workload object.

`swdd~podman-kube-workload-id`

Status: approved

The podman-kube runtime workload id consists of:

* workload execution instance name
* list of pods
* manifest
* down_options

Rationale:
The down_options and the manifest are needed as parameters for `podman kube down`.
The list of pods is needed to get the current state of the workload.

###### Podman-kube create workload creates config volume
`swdd~podman-kube-create-workload-creates-config-volume~1`

Status: approved

When the podman-kube runtime connector is called to create workload, before applying the manifest,
the podman-kube runtime connector shall store the runtime configuration in a volume:

* the data is stored base64 encoded in the label `data` of the volume
* the name of the volume shall be the workload execution instance name suffixed with ".config"

Rationale:
The data stored in this volume is needed, if the agent is restarted to find existing workloads.
It is created before applying the manifest, to ensure the running workload can always be found,
even if the agent crashes during the creation of the workload.

The data is stored in a label and not as content of the volume, as this is easier to implement using the Podman CLI.
Storing the data as content of the volume:

* makes it necessary to put it in a TAR archive, and import it with `podman volume import`.
* does not work with a remote podman instance.

Status: approved

When the podman-kube runtime connector is called to create a workload and the manifest is successfully applied by the podman-kube runtime connector,
the podman-kube runtime connector shall store the pods in a volume:

* the pod list is encoded as JSON
* the JSON data is stored base64 encoded in the label `data` of the volume
* the name of the volume shall be the workload execution instance name suffixed with ".pods"

Rationale:
The data stored in this volume is needed, if the agent is restarted to recreate the podman-kube workload ID.

###### Podman-kube create continues if it cannot create volumes
`swdd~podman-kube-create-continues-if-cannot-create-volume~1`

Status: approved

When the podman-kube runtime connector is called to create a workload and the podman-kube runtime fails to create the config or pods volume,
the podman-kube runtime continues with applying the manifest and returning the workload ID.

Rationale:
The volumes are needed for a restart of the the agent, but are not necessary for the current execution of the agent.
If the agent ignores the failure of creating of the volumes, the workloads can operate normally and only after a restart of the agent errors occur.
If the agent fails the start of a workload if it is not able to create the volumes, the workloads cannot operate currently and after a restart of the agent.

### Getting workload states

This section describes how workload states are sampled inside the Ankaios agent and how they get forwarded to the Ankaios server.

It is required that each runtime connector delivers a state checker when a workload is created. Additionally, the runtime connector provides an extra method for starting a checker for workloads that are resumed by the WorkloadFacade.

How the state checker is implemented is up to the specific runtime connector, given that the state checker trait is implemented. The state checker trait requires a state getter object to be provided. The object must implement the runtime state getter trait and is specific to the runtime connector. The provided state getter object is called inside the state checker.
The extra complexity introduced by having two traits is needed in order to provide common state checker implementations that can be reused among runtime connectors. One of these checkers is the `GenericPollingStateChecker`.

#### General state checker interface
`swdd~agent-general-state-checker-interface~1`

Status: approved

The state checker interface returned by the runtime connectors shall:
* accept a specific runtime state getter object
* support a stop action

Rationale:
The specific runtime state getter allows the implementation of common state checkers.
The stop action is needed in order to stop the state checker when a workload is deleted.

- RuntimeConnectorInterfaces

Needs:
- impl

#### General runtime state getter interface
`swdd~agent-general-runtime-state-getter-interface~1`

The state getter interface shall return one of following workload states:

* starting
* running
* succeeded
* failed
* unknown
* removed
* stopping

#### GenericPollingStateChecker implementation
`swdd~agent-provides-generic-state-checker-implementation~1`

Status: approved

A `GenericPollingStateChecker` implementation is provided that polls the workload state every second via the provided runtime state getter.

Rationale:
The `GenericPollingStateChecker` helps avoiding code duplication.

#### PodmanCli container state cache

##### PodmanCli container state cache contains all containers
`swdd~podmancli-container-state-cache-all-containers~1`

Status: approved

The PodmanCli container state cache shall store the state of all Podman containers.

Rationale:
Calling podman for each workload to get its current state uses unnecessary system resources.
Using this cache only one Podman call is needed to get the states of all Podman workloads (podman runtime and podman-kube runtime).

##### PodmanStateGetter maps workload state
`swdd~podman-state-getter-maps-state~3`

Status: approved

The `PodmanStateGetter` shall map the workload state returned by the Podman into workload states according to the next table:

| Podman Container State | Container ExitCode | Workload State |
| ---------------------- | :----------------: | :------------: |
| Created                |         -          |    Starting    |
| Configured             |         -          |    Starting    |
| Initialized            |         -          |    Starting    |
| Paused                 |         -          |    Unknown     |
| Running                |         -          |    Running     |
| Exited                 |        == 0        |   Succeeded    |
| Exited                 |        != 0        |     Failed     |
| Stopping               |         -          |    Stopping    |
| Stopped                |         -          |    Stopping    |
| Removing               |         -          |    Stopping    |
| (anything else)        |         -          |    Unknown     |

Comment:
The Podman also supports "pod states". This table shows the container states only.
The container states `Stopped` and `Removing` are mapped to the workload state `Stopping`,
because they are considered as transition states from the state `Succeeded` or `Running` into `Removed`.
Mapping the state `Stopped` to a value different than `Stopping` would result in Ankaios reporting shortly some other state during workload deletion.
We are assuming that Ankaios workloads are not managed by an entity different than Ankaios and the container state `Stopped` is only transitionary.
