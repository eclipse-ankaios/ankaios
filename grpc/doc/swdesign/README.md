# gRPC Communication Middleware - SW Design

## About this document

This document describes the Software Design for the gRPC Communication Middleware.

## Context View

![Context](drawio/context_view.drawio.svg)

The gRPC Communication Middleware is a specific implementation of the Ankaios Communication Middleware. It is responsible for handling the communication between an instance of the Ankaios Server and the Agents connected to it including the initial connection of an Agent.

The Ankaios Communication Middleware is specified by two interfaces defined by the Common Library. The gRPC Communication Middleware implements these interfaces.

The Communication Middleware interfaces define how the middleware is started and how data flows in and out of it. To be able to have an easily exchangeable middleware and at the same time reduce the amount of code, the data flow is going through the Communication Channels also defined by the Common library.

## Constraints, risks and decisions

No Constraints or risks are known at the time of writing this document.

### Design decisions

The following section holds the design decisions taken during the development of the gRPC Communication Middleware.

#### Delegate gRPC workflows to the tonic external library
`swdd~grpc-delegate-workflow-to-external-library~1`

Status: approved

Ankaios uses the tonic crate to handle gRPC communication and automatic protobuf code generation.

Rationale:

The tonic crate provides all functionality needed to handle the gRPC communication and thus reduces the implementation and integration effort.

Needs:
- impl

Assumptions:

No assumptions were taken.

Considered alternatives:

* implementing the gRPC protocol completely inside the middleware
* using an http library and a protobuf converter

## Structural view

![Unit overview](drawio/unit_overview.drawio.svg)

### gRPC Client

The gRPC Client handles two types of communication. The first type is for the Ankaios Agent. The second one is for the Anakaios CLI.
Upon startup, the gRPC Client establishes the connection to the server. In case of the Ankaios Agent type of communication the server sends the "Agent Hello".
Where in case of the Ankaios CLI type of communication the server does not send the "Agent Hello".
Once the connection is there, it forwards messages from and to the Ankaios Agent or to the Ankaios CLI depending on the connection type.

### gRPC Server

The gRPC Server handles the communication for the Ankaios Server.
It spawns a green thread that accepts connections from Ankaios Agents and creates a gRPC Agent Connection for each Agent.
The gRPC Server also forwards messages from the Ankaios Server to the Agents.

### Agent Senders Map

The Agent Senders Map holds the sink ends of the channels to the Ankaios Agents.
It also allows concurrent access to the sinks by internal locking.

### Execution Command Proxy

The Execution Command Proxy provides functions that forward the Execution Commands to and from Ankaios via gRPC.
The Proxy functions also do conversion of the transferred objects to the appropriate format.

### State Change Command Proxy

The State Change Command Proxy provides functions that forward the State Change Command to and from Ankaios via gRPC.
The Proxy functions also do conversion of the transferred objects to the appropriate format.

### gRPC Agent Connection

One gRPC Agent Connection is created by the gRPC Server at startup. The gRPC Server then spawns a tonic gRPC service in a new green thread and all calls to the service are handled in tasks by the gRPCAgentConnection.

## Behavioral view

### Forwarding Commands between Ankaios Server and Agent

The following diagram show how the gRPC Connection Middleware forwards messages between the Ankaios Server and Agent:

![Forwarding messages](plantuml/seq_forward_via_grpc.svg)

#### gRPC Server forwards Execution Commands to every gRPC Client in a single call

Status: approved

The gRPC Server uses functionality provided by the Common Library to find all Commands that need to be forwarded to a particular Agent.

Rationale:
The gRPC Server should not implement such functionality on its own as every Communication middleware would probably require the same sorting.

`swdd~grpc-agent-connection-sends-agent-gone~1`

Status: approved

The gRPC Agent Connection shall send an AgentGone messages to the Ankaios Server if the connection to the gRPC Client gets interrupted.

Rationale:
The Ankaios Server must know if the Agent is gone in order to take appropriate measures.

## Data view

The Structure of the objects used by the gRPC Communication Middleware is defined in the protobuf file located under [proto/ankaios.proto](../../proto/ankaios.proto).

## Error management view

Both gRPC Server and Client are developed in a way that handles connection interruptions. The Ankaios Agent and Server shall not fail if the connection is dropped. The connection is either reestablished or the appropriate actions are taken to inform that the connection is interrupted.

An example for such measures is informing the Ankaios Server that the Agent is gone. The Server can then mark all Workloads executed on this Agent with unknown execution state and inform other Agents about the current situation.

## Deployment view

The gRPC Communication Middleware is compiled with the Ankaios Server and Agent and deployed with them. This can be as well es on a single machine communicating over the localhost network (and maybe bypassing it using XDP and eBPF), or on separate machines.
