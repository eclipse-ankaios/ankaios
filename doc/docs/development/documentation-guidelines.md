# Documentation guidelines

These guidelines apply to all documentation which is created in the Ankaios
project like this website, software design documents or README files. The aim is
to support the creators of documents by enforcing a common look and feel.

## Capitalization

As 'Ankaios' is a [proper noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun) it shall be written with a capital 'A'. Other
words which are not proper nouns shall be in lower case when they are not the
first word in a sentence.

Examples:

Correct | Incorrect
------- | ---------
Ankaios | ankaios
Ankaios server | Ankaios-Server, Ankaios-server, Ankaios Server
Ankaios agent | Ankaios-Agent, Ankaios-agent, Ankaios Agent
workload | Workload
control interface | Control Interface

The same rule also applies to headlines, i.e. only the first word of a headline
is in upper case.
