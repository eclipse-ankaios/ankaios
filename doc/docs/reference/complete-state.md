# Working with CompleteState

## CompleteState

The complete state data structure [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) is used for building a request to Ankaios server to change or receive the state of the Ankaios system. It contains the `startupState` which describes the states provided at the start of the Ankaios system via the [startup configuration](./startup-configuration.md), the `desiredState` which describes the state of the Ankaios system the user wants to have and the `workloadStates` which gives the information about the execution state of all the workloads. By using of [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) in conjunction with the object field mask specific parts of the Ankaios state could be retrieved or updated.

Example: `ank get state` returns the complete state of Ankaios system:

```bash
startupState:
  apiVersion: v0.1
  workloads: {}
desiredState:
  apiVersion: v0.1
  workloads:
    hello-pod:
      agent: agent_B
      tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
      dependencies: {}
      restartPolicy: NEVER
      runtime: podman-kube
      runtimeConfig: |
        manifest: |
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Pod
          metadata:
            name: hello-pod
          spec:
            restartPolicy: Never
            containers:
            - name: looper
              image: alpine:latest
              command:
              - sleep
              - 50000
            - name: greater
              image: alpine:latest
              command:
              - echo
              - "Hello from a container in a pod"
    hello1:
      agent: agent_B
      tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
      dependencies: {}
      runtime: podman
      runtimeConfig: |
        image: alpine:latest
        commandOptions: [ "--rm"]
        commandArgs: [ "echo", "Hello Ankaios"]
    hello2:
      agent: agent_B
      tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
      dependencies: {}
      restartPolicy: ALWAYS
      runtime: podman
      runtimeConfig: |
        image: alpine:latest
        commandOptions: [ "--entrypoint", "/bin/sh" ]
        commandArgs: [ "-c", "echo 'Always restarted.'; sleep 2"]
    nginx:
      agent: agent_A
      tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
      dependencies: {}
      restartPolicy: ON_FAILURE
      runtime: podman
      runtimeConfig: |
        image: docker.io/nginx:latest
        commandOptions: ["-p", "8081:80"]
workloadStates: []
```

It is not necessary to provide the whole structure of the the [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) data structure when using it in conjunction with the [object field mask](#object-field-mask). It is sufficient to provide the relevant branch of the [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) object. As an example, to change the restart behavior of the nginx workload, only the relevant branch of the [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) needs to be provided:

```bash
desiredState:
  workloads:
    nginx:
      restartPolicy: ALWAYS
```

## Object field mask

With the object field mask only specific parts of the Ankaios state could be retrieved or updated.
The object field mask can be constructed using the field names of the [CompleteState](./_ankaios.proto.md#completestate) data structure:

```text
<top level field name>.<second level field name>.<third level field name>.<...>
```

1. Example: `ank get state desiredState.workloads.nginx` returns only the information about nginx workload:

   ```yaml
    desiredState:
      workloads:
        nginx:
          agent: agent_A
          tags:
          - key: owner
            value: Ankaios team
          dependencies: {}
          restartPolicy: ALWAYS
          runtime: podman
          runtimeConfig: |
            image: docker.io/nginx:latest
            commandOptions: ["-p", "8081:80"]
   ```

2. Example `ank get state desiredState.workloads.nginx.runtimeConfig` returns only the runtime configuration of nginx workload:

   ```yaml
   desiredState:
     workloads:
       nginx:
         runtimeConfig: |
           image: docker.io/nginx:latest
           commandOptions: ["-p", "8081:80"]
   ```

3. Example `ank set state -f new-state.yaml desiredState.workloads.nginx.restartPolicy` changes the restart behavior of nginx workload to `NEVER`:

   ```yaml title="new-state.yaml"
   desiredState:
     workloads:
       nginx:
         restartPolicy: NEVER
   ```
