# Quickstart

If you have not installed Ankaios, please follow the instructions
[here](installation.md). The following examples assumes that the
installation script has been used with default options.

You can start workloads in Ankaios in a number of ways.
For example, you can define a file with the startup configuration and use systemd to start Ankaios.
The startup configuration file contains all of the workloads and their configuration that you want to be started by Ankaios.

Let's modify the default config which is stored in `/etc/ankaios/state.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v0.1
workloads:
  nginx:
    runtime: podman
    agent: agent_A
    restartPolicy: ALWAYS
    tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
    runtimeConfig: |
      image: docker.io/nginx:latest
      commandOptions: ["-p", "8081:80"]
```

Then we can start the Ankaios server:

```shell
sudo systemctl start ank-server
```

The Ankaios server will read the config but detect that no agent with the name
`agent_A` is available that could start the workload, see logs with:

```shell
journalctl -t ank-server
```

Now let's start an agent:

```shell
sudo systemctl start ank-agent
```

This Ankaios agent will run the workload that has been assigned to it. We can
use the Ankaios CLI to check the current state:

```shell
ank get state
```

which creates:

```yaml
startupState:
  apiVersion: v0.1
  workloads: {}
desiredState:
  apiVersion: v0.1
  workloads:
    nginx:
      agent: agent_A
      tags:
      - key: owner
        value: Ankaios team
      dependencies: {}
      restartPolicy: ALWAYS
      runtime: podman
      runtimeConfig: |
        image: docker.io/nginx:latest
        commandOptions: ["-p", "8081:80"]
workloadStates:
- instanceName:
    agentName: agent_A
    workloadName: nginx
    id: 7d6ea2b79cea1e401beee1553a9d3d7b5bcbb37f1cfdb60db1fbbcaa140eb17d
  executionState:
    state: Running
    subState: Ok
    additionalInfo: ''
```

or

```shell
ank get workloads
```

which results in:

```text
WORKLOAD NAME   AGENT     RUNTIME   EXECUTION STATE   ADDITIONAL INFO
 nginx           agent_A   podman    Running(Ok)
```

Ankaios also supports adding and removing workloads dynamically.
To add another workload call:

```shell
ank run workload \
helloworld \
--runtime podman \
--agent agent_A \
--config 'image: docker.io/busybox:1.36
commandOptions: [ "-e", "MESSAGE=Hello World"]
commandArgs: [ "sh", "-c", "echo $MESSAGE"]'
```

We can check the state again with `ank get state` and see, that the workload
`helloworld` has been added to `desiredState.workloads` and the execution
state is available in `workloadStates`.

As the workload had a one time job its state is `Succeeded(Ok)` and we can
delete it from the state again with:

```shell
ank delete workload helloworld
```

For next steps follow the [tutorial on sending and receiving vehicle data](tutorial-vehicle-signals.md) with workloads orchestrated by Ankaios.
Then also check the reference documentation for the
[startup configuration](../reference/startup-configuration.md) including the
`podman-kube` runtime and also working with the
[complete state data structure](../reference/complete-state.md).
