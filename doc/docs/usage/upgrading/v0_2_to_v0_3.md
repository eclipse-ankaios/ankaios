# Upgrading v0.2 to v0.3

When upgrading from v0.2 to v0.3, the installation script simply needs to be run again. However, due to breaking changes, some manual adjustments are required for existing configurations and workloads.

## Configurations

`CompleteState`

* `currentState` has been renamed to `desiredState`

`State`

* New mandatory field `apiVersion`
* The field `restart` has been renamed to `restartPolicy` and the value is not boolean but an enum.
* `configs` and `cronjobs` have been removed.

`Workload`

* `accessRights` and `updateStrategy` have been removed.

## API

Application using the control interface or communication directly with the Ankaios server need to be adapted.

A new `ToServer` message, `Request`, has been introduced.
The two message `UpdateStateRequest` and `CompleteStateRequest` have been moved to the new `Request` message.

A new `FromServer` message, `Response`, has been introduced.
The `CompletState` message has been moved to the new `Reponse` message.
Additionally, the Ankaios server now response to an `UpdateStateRequest` with an `UpdateStateSuccess` or `Error` message,
which are both of type `Response`.
