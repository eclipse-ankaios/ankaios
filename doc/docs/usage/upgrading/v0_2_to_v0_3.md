# Upgrading v0.2 to v0.3

When upgrading from v0.2 to v0.3, the installation script simply needs to be run again. However, due to breaking changes, some manual adjustments will be required for existing configurations and workloads.

`CompleteState`

* `currentState` has been renamed to `desiredState`

`State`

* New mandatory field `apiVersion`
* The field `restart` has been renamed to `restartPolicy` and the value is not boolean but an enum.
