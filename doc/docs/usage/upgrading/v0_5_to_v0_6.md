# Upgrading v0.5 to v0.6

When upgrading from v0.5 to v0.6, the installation script simply needs to be ran again. The v0.6 release does not contain any breaking changes as the newly included features only extend the existing interface. As with every minor release, using the newly added features is only possible when using the newly released v0.6 binaries.

## Eventual Consistency

Although there are no breaking API changes in this release, the eventual consistency feature does change the behavior of Ankaios in respect to retrying the start of failing workloads.

Up to v0.5 Ankaios only retried for 20 times in equal intervals to start a workload before marking it as failed to start. With the eventual consistency feature in v0.6, Ankaios is now indefinitely retrying to start the workload.
To prevents overwhelming a service and reduce contention, the retries are done with exponential backoff and jitter.
