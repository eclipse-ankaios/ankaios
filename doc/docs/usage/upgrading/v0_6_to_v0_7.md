# Upgrading v0.6 to v0.7

When upgrading from v0.6 to v0.7, the installation script simply needs to be ran again. However, due to some breaking changes, some manual adjustments are required for existing workloads using the control interface.

## Control Interface Accepted message

For the stability of the communication, a new message was introduced that confirms the connection of a workload to the control interface, after Ankaios receives the initial `Hello`.

```proto
message ControlInterfaceAccepted {
}
```

## Podman-kube control interface

Using the control interface with a podman-kube workload is now possible. Because of the way podman-kube works, the control interface will be setup for the specified pod and container, with the mount point being `podName/containerName`. Other containers from the same or other pods do not have access to the control interface.

Config example for configuring control interface access to a podman-kube workload (not all required fields are present):

```yaml
apiVersion: v0.1
workloads:
  simple:
    runtime: podman-kube
    runtimeConfig: |
      controlInterfaceTarget: pod_A/container_A
      manifest: |
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: pod_A
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
          - name: container_A
            image: ghcr.io/eclipse-ankaios/tests/alpine:latest
            command: ["sleep", "12000"]
```
