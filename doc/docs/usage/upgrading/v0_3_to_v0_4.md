# Upgrading v0.3 to v0.4

When upgrading from v0.3 to v0.4, the installation script simply needs to be run again. However, due to some breaking changes, some manual adjustments are required for existing workloads using the control interface and applications directly using the gRPC API of the Ankaios server.

## Control interface

The control interface has been decoupled from the API for server-agent communication, now exclusively handling essential messages with newly named identifiers for clarity.

To upgrade to the new version v0.4, use the new `control_api.proto` file and two new messages:

* `ToAnkaios`
* `FromAnkaios`

The new messages currently support requests and responses to and from Ankaios and will later support other functionality. The `Request` and `Response` messages and their content remain the same, but are now located in the `ank_base.proto` file.

A sample how the new definition of the Control Interface is used can be found in the examples from [the Ankaios repository](https://github.com/eclipse-ankaios/ankaios).

The reason for splitting some messages into the dedicated file `ank_base.proto`, is that they are also used for the gRPC API of the Ankaios server. This API is mainly used by the Ankaios agents and CLI, but could also be used by third party applications to directly communicate with the Ankaios server. The following chapter details the changes needed to upgrade to v0.4 in case you are using this API.

## gRPC API of the Ankaios server

Ankaios facilitates server-agent-CLI communication through an interchangeable middleware, currently implemented using gRPC. By segregating the gRPC API into a distinct `grpc_api.proto` file, we clearly show the target and purpose of this interface.

If you are using the gRPC API of the Ankaios server directly (and not the CLI), you would need to cope with the splitting of the messaged into `grpc_api.proto` and `ank_base.proto`. Apart from that, the API itself is exactly the same.

## Authentication and encryption

Starting from v0.4.0 Ankaios supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between server, agent and `ank` CLI.
The default installation script will install Ankaios without mTLS.
When using the `ank` CLI with such an installation, the arguments `--insecure` or `-k` have to be passed.

So

```shell
ank get workloads
```

will have to be changed to

```shell
ank -k get workloads
```

Alternatively, set the environment variable `ANK_INSECURE=true` to avoid passing the `-k` argument to each `ank` CLI command.
