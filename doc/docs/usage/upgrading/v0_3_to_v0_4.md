# Upgrading v0.3 to v0.4

When upgrading from v0.3 to v0.4, the installation script simply needs to be run again. However, due to some breaking changes, some manual adjustments are required for existing workloads using the Control Interface and applications directly using the gRPC API of the Ankaios server.

## Control Interface

The Control Interface is now completely separated from the API defining the communication between a server an an agent and allows sending only the relevant for the Control Interface messages. To make this more obvious and to avoid confusion, the messages are also renamed.

To upgrade to the new version v0.4, use the new `control_api.proto` file and two new messages:

* `ToAnkaios`
* `FromAnkaios`

The new messages currently support requests and responses to and from Ankaios and will later support other functionality. The `Request` and `Response` messages and their content remain the same, but are now located in the `ank_base.proto` file.

A sample how the new definition of the Control Interface ise used can be found in the examples from [the Ankaios repository](https://github.com/eclipse-ankaios/ankaios).

The reason for splitting some messages into the dedicated file `ank_base.proto`, is that they are also used for the gRPC API of the Ankaios server. This API is mainly used by the Ankaios agents and CLI, but could also be used by third party applications to directly communicate with the Ankaios server. The following chapter details the changes needed to upgrade to v0.4 in case you are using this API.

## gRPC API of the Ankaios Server

Ankaios is designed for an interchangeable communication middleware between the server, the agents and the CLI. The currently available, and thus default, implementation is done with gRPC. In oder to make it more clear which messages belong to the fixed Control Interface and which to the interchangeable gRPC middleware, we have carved out the gRPC API into a separate file named `grpc_api.proto`.

If you are using the gRPC API of the Ankaios server directly (and not the CLI), you would need to cope with the splitting of the messaged into `grpc_api.proto` and `ank_base.proto`. Apart from that, the API itself is exactly the same.
