## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability in Ankaios or one of the SDKs, you can create a [private vulnerability report using Github](https://github.com/eclipse-ankaios/ankaios/security/advisories/new).
In this case the Ankaios committers will be informed and only you and the committers will have access to this vulnerability report and you will get feedback there once the report has been analyzed.
In the form to fill out, only the title and description are required, the rest of the fields are optional.
